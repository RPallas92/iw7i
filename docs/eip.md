## Lab 5 Enterprise Integration Patterns

This laboratory will consist of a series of tasks designed to familiarize you with the concept 
[Enterprise Integration Pattern](http://www.eaipatterns.com/). It is expected that students use the online 
documentation of the [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/index.html) integration framework during the laboratory extensively.

### Task 5.1: Install `iw7i-reportincident`

The [report incident](http://camel.apache.org/tutorial-example-reportincident.html) is a tutorial of the Apache Camel integration framework inspired by a real life use-case. The target reader is person whom hasn't experience or just started using Camel. `iw7i-reportincident` contains a modified version of the application built with this tutorial. Install it in your development environment. However, the core of the solution has been ***accidentally*** deleted.

### Task 5.2: Route `web service` to `file backup`

### Task 5.3: Route `file backup` to `mail`

### Task 5.4: Camel routes

### Task 5.5: Route `twitter` to `facebook`

Create an application that copy to your Facebook account a summary of your recent tweets periodically. It is advisable to use the [Facebook API](http://camel.apache.org/facebook.html) component and the [Twitter API](http://camel.apache.org/twitter.html) component.
